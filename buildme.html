                    Have you ever woken up with the motivation or urge to accomplish a new goal? 
                    As you embark on this journey you realize you don't know where to start. 
                    You begin to realize it's tough to eliminate bad habits and start new ones. 
                    Nowadays, lots of people have turned to habit-tracking apps to help them out. 
                    Due to factors like technology fatigue many users find themselves going through the motions and have a hard time staying committed to the process of betterment. 
                    In this case study, we will explore the effectiveness of BuildMe and the features my team designed to combat the pain points.

                    exercise and was to be completed in one month. Despite the timeline, the project 
                    would be open for further development and improvements.

                    As a designer, I was given the added responsibility of being a 
                    facilitator and content collector. This meant that I had to 
                    assist with time management and keep the team on track during 
                    our daily meetings. I made sure that we stayed focused on our 
                    ideations and didn't get sidetracked by unrelated conversations. 
                    Additionally, I helped to recap previous meetings, discussions 
                    and summarized deliverables to ensure that everyone was on the 
                    same page. It was a challenging role, but one that I was happy 
                    to take on and contribute to the success of the project.

                <p>
                    Before we could start designing our app a great deal of 
                    preliminary research had to be done. During our own experiences, 
                    we came across the book <span>Atomic Habits</span>  by James Clear which we all 
                    felt was a good basis for our hypothesis on creating habits. 
                    This book would help inform the features we would develop. 
                    Our project lead suggested that we follow a sprint format 
                    inspired by the book <span>Sprint</span> by Jake Knapp, and we all agreed. 
                    We took the time to condense and lay out a structure for our 
                    sprint.

                <p>
                    We spent some time looking at other habit-tracking apps in the market. 
                    We analyzed what worked well and what didn't in these apps. 
                    This helped us to get a better understanding of what our app needs to have to be successful.

                <p>
                    In addition to analyzing other habit-tracking apps in the market, 
                    I researched Habitica, the Forest App and Study Bunny to gather more 
                    information on how to create motivating factors during habit creation. 
                    I believe we can draw inspiration from these apps, as they offer unique 
                    approaches to habit tracking.

                <p>
                    This research has culminated in the feedback loop below. 
                    Through our discussions on habits, we saw a pattern in the 
                    way users used habit apps and how they looked at habit creation. 
                    The loop focuses on creating what users consider a "good habit" 
                    and breaking a "bad habit."

                    Our team worked collaboratively to develop mood boards that helped 
                    us establish the look and feel of our project. I was responsible for 
                    creating a mood board that incorporated shades and tones of yellow 
                    and green. These colors were chosen based on their psychological 
                    properties and their ability to promote an accepting and active 
                    atmosphere. By using these colors, we hope to create an engaging 
                    and motivating experience for our users.

                <p>
                    As a team, we wanted to ensure that our habit-tracking application met 
                    the needs and expectations of our target audience. To achieve this, 
                    we compiled a set of interview questions that covered important 
                    demographics and reflections. Additionally, I helped recruit survey 
                    participants to gather even more valuable insights. By taking these 
                    steps, we hope to create a user-friendly and effective application 
                    that truly meets the needs of our users.

                        Our success strategy required we hold each other responsible and express 
                        concerns about the project. It was still understood that the project lead 
                        would have the decision-making authority. After compiling our ideas, 
                        we constructed a proper habit creation map and decided which features 
                        followed this idea. This led to us focusing on helping users understand their habits.
