                    Have you ever woken up with the motivation or urge to accomplish a new goal? 
                    As you embark on this journey you realize you don't know where to start. 
                    You begin to realize it's tough to eliminate bad habits and start new ones. 
                    Nowadays, lots of people have turned to habit-tracking apps to help them out. 
                    Due to factors like technology fatigue many users find themselves going through the motions and have a hard time staying committed to the process of betterment. 
                    In this case study, we will explore the effectiveness of BuildMe and the features my team designed to combat the pain points.

                    exercise and was to be completed in one month. Despite the timeline, the project 
                    would be open for further development and improvements.

                        First, I analyzed competitors like PayPal and Google Pay. I wanted to understand their strengths
                        and
                        weaknesses in a broader sense to find a gap in the market. After conducting market research, I
                        compiled all
                        the information on each competitor and created a S.W.O.T. analysis. This helped me initiate
                        ideas of what
                        users might expect from my app. I also broke down what competitors are doing right to solve
                        their user's
                        problems and ways they are underserving.

                        were created to help me understand my target audiences. Once I had a general idea of the type of
                        users that
                        would use my application I created a
                        few user flows like the one below to simulate what their work flows would look like within
                        the application. Below is a user flow that illustrates what users like Victoria would try to
                        accomplish:

                        Once my sitemap was done and I had the structure in my head, I began to create
                        drafts of how the application would look. I created a few sketches by hand and
                        digitally before committing to one that felt like it made the most sense. The rapid
                        prototyping phase was very flexible. I was able to focus on the "big picture" ideas
                        without getting caught up in details.

                        categorized the

                        My original hypothesis still encapsulates what I am trying to solve for users in this
                        sector. Users want a finance application that helps them enjoy handling their finances.
                        People are always looking for a finance app that is convenient and easy to use, but
                        they're aren't many that are fun to use. My proposed solution of introducing gamifying
                        features is viable but there is additional research that needs to be done. Subsequent
                        user testing may change into a form of beta testing for full workflows on a live version of
                        the app. Iterative design is flexible in this aspect because it allows for these changes to
                        take place essentially at any stage.
