                    Have you ever woken up with the motivation or urge to accomplish a new goal?
                    As you embark on this journey you realize you don't know where to start.
                    You begin to realize it's tough to eliminate bad habits and start new ones.
                    Nowadays, lots of people have turned to habit-tracking apps to help them out.
                    Due to factors like technology fatigue many users find themselves going through the motions and have
                    a hard time staying committed to the process of betterment.
                    In this case study, we will explore the effectiveness of BuildMe and the features my team designed
                    to combat the pain points.

                            As my team discovered habit creation is influenced by a combination of intrinsic and

                        As a designer, I was given the added responsibility of being a
                        facilitator and content collector. This meant that I had to
                        assist with time management and keep the team on track during
                        our daily meetings. I made sure that we stayed focused on our
                        ideations and didn't get sidetracked by unrelated conversations.
                        Additionally, I helped to recap previous meetings, discussions
                        and summarized deliverables to ensure that everyone was on the
                        same page. It was a challenging role, but one that I was happy
                        to take on and contribute to the success of the project.

                    <p>
                        Before we could start designing our app a great deal of
                        preliminary research had to be done. During our own experiences,
                        we came across the book <span>Atomic Habits</span> by James Clear which we all
                        felt was a good basis for our hypothesis on creating habits.
                        This book would help inform the features we would develop.
                        Our project lead suggested that we follow a sprint format
                        inspired by the book <span>Sprint</span> by Jake Knapp, and we all agreed.
                        We took the time to condense and lay out a structure for our
                        sprint.

                    <p>
                        We spent some time looking at other habit-tracking apps in the market.
                        We analyzed what worked well and what didn't in these apps.
                        This helped us to get a better understanding of what our app needs to have to be successful.

                    <p>
                        In addition to analyzing other habit-tracking apps in the market,
                        I researched Habitica, the Forest App and Study Bunny to gather more
                        information on how to create motivating factors during habit creation.
                        I believe we can draw inspiration from these apps, as they offer unique
                        approaches to habit tracking.

                        This research has culminated in the feedback loop below.
                        Through our discussions on habits, we saw a pattern in the
                        way users used habit apps and how they looked at habit creation.
                        The loop focuses on creating what users consider a "good habit"
                        and breaking a "bad habit."

                        Our team worked collaboratively to develop mood boards that helped
                        us establish the look and feel of our project. I was responsible for
                        creating a mood board that incorporated shades and tones of yellow
                        and green. These colors were chosen based on their psychological
                        properties and their ability to promote an accepting and active
                        atmosphere. By using these colors, we hope to create an engaging
                        and motivating experience for our users.

                        As a team, we wanted to ensure that our habit-tracking application met
                        the needs and expectations of our target audience. To achieve this,
                        we compiled a set of interview questions that covered important
                        demographics and reflections. Additionally, I helped recruit survey
                        participants to gather even more valuable insights. By taking these
                        steps, we hope to create a user-friendly and effective application
                        that truly meets the needs of our users.

                        During our sprint, we utilized a group activity called Crazy 8s.
                        It was a technique that allows us to generate feature ideas and
                        patterns. Once the ideas are generated we iterate on our
                        solutions as many times as possible within an hour of drafting
                        features. It served as a brainstorming session during our sprint.

                        Our success strategy required we hold each other responsible and express
                        concerns about the project. It was still understood that the project lead
                        would have the decision-making authority. After compiling our ideas,
                        we constructed a proper habit creation map and decided which features
                        followed this idea. This led to us focusing on helping users understand their habits.

                    <p>
                        Once we completed the development of the new version of BuildMe and added
                        all the features, we wanted to be sure that our habit-tracking app fulfilled
                        the requirements and expectations of our intended users. To accomplish this,
                        we arranged for five user testing sessions. During these sessions, we followed
                        a test script and compiled a list of open-ended post-test questions to encourage
                        users to share their valuable insights.
                        We encountered some issues during our initial test, which prompted us to make some
                        on-the-spot adjustments. After conducting the final test, we had to address the
                        shortcomings we identified and the multiple issues that arose during user testing of the design.

                    <p>In conclusion, I believe BuildMe has the potential to be a great and useful product.
                        I am proud of the work my team has accomplished in a short amount of time.
                        As a team, we worked together to come up with various ideas and versions, even
                        competing with each other. The most important lesson we learned was to be flexible
                        with different work processes and put aside our egos to create a product that serves
                        our target audience. In the case study, you can see how we made decisions that led to
                        a room design that promotes both comfort and productivity, as well as user-friendly
                        questionnaires to help people understand their habits.

                    We encountered a few challenges during the development process. Conducting user interviews
                    proved to be difficult, as we encountered some users who were not easy to understand and
                    required our full attention to properly test our application. Additionally, we had to adapt
                    and sometimes discard features we had initially planned. After our first round of user
                    testing, we spent some time reconsidering what features were truly valuable and contributed
                    to a comfortable user experience. However, due to the project's time constraints, we were
                    unable to conduct extensive tests after addressing these issues.

                    Reflecting on the project, I realize how much progress I have made and I am enthusiastic
                    about my future growth and learning. This project allowed me to enhance my teamwork skills
                    and I am grateful for the chance. Thank you for reviewing my work and I hope it was useful
                    and informative.</p>
